Data Analyst,EducationSuperHighway," San Francisco, CA"," The Company: EducationSuperHighway is the leading non-profit focused on upgrading the Internet access in every public school classroom in America. We believe that digital learning has the potential to provide all students equal access to educational opportunity and that every school requires high-speed broadband to make that opportunity a reality. EducationSuperHighways data-driven programs help accelerate upgrades in Americas schools. We catalyze federal and state action on K-12 broadband initiatives, we get fiber to schools that need it, and we make broadband more affordable for school districts. Our work helped shape President Obamas ConnectED initiative and served as a catalyst for modernization of the Federal Communications Commissions $3.9 billion E-rate program, earning our CEO the 2015 Visionary of the Year award from the San Francisco Chronicle. The Team: The strategic analysis team has been instrumental in EducationSuperHighways success. This team takes an abstract question like ""How much funding does the Federal E-Rate program need to support Internet infrastructure upgrades in schools"" and provides a tangible, concrete answer backed by compelling research and analysis. They structure the problem: ""What factors drive demand for broadband? How will the advancements in technology impact this demand? What are the technological and economic drivers of broadband cost?"" They conduct primary and secondary research to quantify each of those factors and determine how they interact with one another, including collecting and performing statistical analysis on a wide variety of data sets. They use the research to build a model that shows how various assumptions impact how much money would be required, and produce a white paper summarizing key findings and implications for policy levers. They work with the best information available and clearly communicate their assumptions - and by doing this, they can have meaningful, timely impact. This project, for example, resulted in adding $1.5 billion dollars per year to the Federal E-Rate program, an increase of 62%. In 2015, the strategic analysis team will be responsible for defining an approach to build business cases to persuade state governments to invest in infrastructure upgrades, developing scalable analysis tools that enable the State and District tools to help clients identify their key problem areas, and modeling the economics of different options for getting schools connected so that district and state leaders can make informed decisions. The Role: Analysts are responsible for providing insightful, rigorously-validated answers to the strategic problems that EducationSuperHighway tackles at a national, state, and district level. You are good at talking to people to understand their problems, which may or may not be what they initially think, and defining a structured analytical approach to help them answer their questions and advance their goals. You believe that facts and informed analysis are critical to good decision-making. As a result, you have spent most of your career to date analyzing and interpreting facts. Some may even marvel at the amazing things you can do with data. Excel is to you as an extra hand might be to an acrobat. You go above and beyond in your analysis to answer questions at the goal-level, not just the fact-level. You are critical about data's imperfections but creative about using it to drive to insight. For example, when data answers one question, it inevitably asks several more, and you continue that conversation until it has helped you reach a conclusion that matches your real-world judgment and has actionable implications. You have at least dabbled in statistics - it is a tool you use when you have robust, reliable data available, and it is a mindset that you apply to all of your work. You have also worked enough with data to know that it is often neither reliable nor robust, and you are very accustomed to creatively using what you have, combined with qualitative assessment, to reach conclusions. You take pride in being rigorous, practical, and creative. WHAT YOU WILL DO   Ensure that we solve problems for states and districts in a manner that is both rigorous and repeatable. Structure new analyses to answer strategic questions with data. To the extent a question is posed that we have not yet tried to answer, and we decide answering that question is important, you will be tasked with developing a repeatable, credible methodology for answering it. You will work closely with state and district consultants, meeting directly with state and district leaders where needed, to figure out the best approach. Standardize and automate the analyses that have been done. Your goal is to allow the state and district consulting teams to work as independently as possible. This means that if we have already figured out how to approach the problem, your focus will shift to figuring out how to create a tool, either an excel model or something more robust in partnership with our software team.  Conduct on-boarding sessions training state and district consulting teams on how to use the tools you create. Make sure they understand what types of qualitative information will need to be gathered before conclusions are communicated to states and districts. Make the data available and actionable for states and districts. Ensure that the analyses available via our reporting portal are useful for making good decisions, and perhaps more importantly, could not be misinterpreted in a manner that would lead to poor decisions. You will write the logic / calculations that are used to manipulate the data before it is displayed to the world.   EXAMPLES OF THE PROBLEMS YOU WILL WORK TO SOLVE   How much progress are K-12 schools making against the goals of the national ConnectED initiative and the FCC's targets? What metrics and measures should we use to assess a state's performance in K-12 broadband? What types of districts are most behind  in our partner states and nationwide? What are the economic implications of school infrastructure upgrades for states and districts? How should states and districts make the most efficient use of the additional $1.5B of funding available through the FCC's E-rate program?   YOU HAVE   Bachelors degree, preferably with a quantitative background 2-4 years experience as an analyst in a business strategy, finance, education, or public policy context; management consulting and/or finance background preferred Aptitude for big-picture thinking combined with an impeccable attention to detail Passion for making meaning of large, complex, imperfect data sets Intellectual curiosity that drives a rigorous, action-oriented problem-solving approach Ability to draw actionable insight from quantitative analysis Excel expertise and PowerPoint proficiency required; experience with data visualization, statistical analysis, or programming is a bonus   To apply, please send a resume and cover letter describing your interest and qualifications. Please note that resumes submitted without cover letters will not be considered. EducationSuperHighway is an equal opportunity employer."
